ESP106 --- Week 3 --- Part 2

1) create a github account (if you do not have one)

2) create a new (private) repository called "esp106-your_name" (fill in your name or part of it)

3) add Robert (rhijmans) and Judy as collaborators to that repository

4) use git to clone the repo to your computer

5) put the R file from the Monday lab in the repo folder

6) use git to add, commit and push

7) put a new (blank) R markdown file in the repo folder

8) add, commit and push

9) edit the readme for the repo on github.com

10) pull the changed readme to your local repo

11) transfer Monday's lab to the Rmarkdown file. Use nice markup (sections, bold, ...) and ample English.
commit changes frequently (e.g. after each question). 

12) push when you are done. Make sure that the Rmarkdown file compiles. That will be a strict requirement for a good grade. If there are parts of the code that you cannot get to work --- and that will likely happen now or later --- you can, for example, use code chunk option `eval=FALSE`.
