## This is the lab for Monday, week 1. 
## Add working R code inbetween the questions
## The chapters refer to the sections in https://rspatial.org/intr/index.html

## Chapter 2

## 1) create a vector with all uneven numbers between 1 and 25


## 2) create, and assign to a variable, a vector with the names of four California cities 


## 3) test whether the names in the variable created above include a space


## 4) change the above created (character) variable into a categorical variable (factor)


## 5) create a the following sequence of 20 numbers: 5, 10, 15, ..., 100


## Chapter 3


## 6) create a variable 'x' that holds this matrix (without typing in all the numbers!)

##     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
##[1,]    5   10   15   20
##[2,]   25   30   35   40
##[3,]   45   50   55   60
##[4,]   65   70   75   80
##[5,]   85   90   95  100


## 7) add, to the matrix above, a column with the values 1 to 5


## 8) create a data.frame of the four California cities from question 2 and add two numerical variables (e.g. population) (the numbers do not matter).


## 9) create a list than contains the answers to question 1, 2, 3, and 4

## Chapter 4

## 10) create a matrix by sub-setting matrix 'x' (question 6) by extracting the third and fourth column of 'x'


## 11) which elements in matrix 'x' are larger than 80?


## Chapter 5

## 12) create 20 random numbers between 0 and 1 

## 13) multiply them by 100

## 14) create a 5 x 4 matrix 'y' of these numbers

## 15) multiply this matrix with a vector of 1 to 5

## 16) multiply 'y' with 'x'


## Chapter 6

## R comes with some data sets. See `data()` for a list. These are useful for examples and exercises.  
## E.g. "state.x77"

## 17) Write the state.x77 data to a "text" file (e.g. "csv" format)


## 18) Read the data from this file into a variable "states"


## 19) What is the number of columns of state.x77 and of states? And why are they different?


## Chapter 7

## 20) for each variable in state.x77, use a function to compute the minimim and a function to compute the mean value 


## 21) Use functions summary, table, quantile, and boxplot to summarize the data for life expectancy in the state.x77 data
